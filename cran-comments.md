It's difficult to tell if similar utilities already exist so if this package is not
novel enough for CRAN then let me know.

## Test environments
* Local Kubuntu 20.04.2: R-4.0.0, and R-devel.
* win-builder (devel, release, and oldrelease)

## R CMD check results
* No errors or warnings.
* One note - new submission.
