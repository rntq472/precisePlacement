Description: Provides a selection of tools that make it easier to place elements onto a (base R) plot exactly where you want them. It allows users to identify points and distances on a plot in terms of inches, pixels, margin lines, and data units in a manner more simple than manipulating par(). It helps users identify where exactly the margin lines of a plot fall and to create sub-figures.
