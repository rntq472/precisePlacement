Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Jasper",
           family = "Watson",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "jasper.g.watson@gmail.com")
Description: Provides a selection of tools that make it easier to place elements onto a (base R) plot exactly where you want them. It allows users to identify points and distances on a plot in terms of inches, pixels, margin lines, data units, and proportions of the plotting space, all in a manner more simple than manipulating par().
